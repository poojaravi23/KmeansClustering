# KmeansClustering

In this Program, we use IRIS dataset: Importing the sample IRIS dataset, Converting the dataset to a Pandas Dataframe, Visualizing the classifications using scatter plots, Simple performance metrics.

Program steps:
1. Calculate a centroid randomly
2. Find the Euclidean distance between each data point and each cluster.
3. Assign the data point to the cluster that have the minimum Euclidean distance
4. Calculate the new centroid as the mean of cluster values for each of the k cluster considered
5. k value is considered to be 3.
